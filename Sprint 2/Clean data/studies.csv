Additionally, Source code for the developed app will be made available as open source software on GitHub so it can be evolved for future work by others.",2/1/2021 6:39:55 AM,2/1/2021 6:39:55 AM

However renegotiation of the DTUAs between the 21 health systems and the University of Wisconsin is anticipated during 2021.

NCT04381923,6975825,Randomized,Crossover Assignment,,Supportive Care,,Single,,This will be a randomized study with alternating treatment assignment in which all advanced respiratory units will be assigned to use one of two default interventions (helmet CPAP vs HFNO) as the first-line treatment for refractory hypoxemia (defined as an oxygen saturation (Sp02) of 92% or less on on ≥ 6 LPM (liters per minute) nasal cannula (NC) oxygen). The first-line treatment will be alternated in each unit at 14-day intervals. The initial assignment will be determined by a computer randomization scheme. Patients who are still on their assigned intervention during crossover will remain on that assigned intervention. A design with numerous short periods and frequent crossovers was selected to minimize the risk of changes over time in the patient population and usual care confounding trial results. A 14-day period is also felt to be the minimal time needed to ensure device availability and adherence.,False,False,False,True

A coin flip wil be utlize to minimize the possibility of familiarization or training effects, and maintain complete randomness of the assignment of which RE conditions is performed first, in addition to which leg is tested first. This simple randomization method to determine the assignment will follow (heads = No mask, tails = surgical mask and heads = dominant leg 1st, tails = nondominant leg 1st, on the 1st and 2nd coin toss, respectively). Study participants will be asked which leg they prefer to kick a ball with to identify their dominant leg for data collection purposes","This is a prospective study conducted using a randomized-control crossover design where participants will complete resistance exercise (RE) protocol utilizing a Biodex System 4 and Advantage V5 software with a standard leg attachment, on 2 separate days with at least 48 hours and no greater than seven days between tests.",False,False,False,False
